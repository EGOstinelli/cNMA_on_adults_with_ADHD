Legend:
 comparison - Treatment comparison
 k          - Number of studies providing direct evidence
 prop       - Direct evidence proportion
 nma        - Estimated treatment effect (SMD) in network meta-analysis
 direct     - Estimated treatment effect (SMD) derived from direct evidence
 indir.     - Estimated treatment effect (SMD) derived from indirect evidence
 Diff       - Difference between direct and indirect treatment estimates
 z          - z-value of test for disagreement (direct versus indirect)
 p-value    - p-value of test for disagreement (direct versus indirect)

Percent of comparisons where there is some evidence (p-value<0.05) of disagreement between direct and indirect sources: NaN (0 out of 0 comparisons).
